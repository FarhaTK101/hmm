# Hidden Markov Model – Baum-Welch Visualizer
NAME : FARHA T K
  REGISTER NUMBER : TCR24CS027

An interactive web-based visualization tool for understanding Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and the Baum-Welch training algorithm.

This application allows users to generate observation sequences, train an HMM model, and visualize:

Log-likelihood convergence

Transition matrix (heatmap)

Emission matrix (heatmap)

State posterior probabilities over time

Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Plotly.js — all in a single file with no backend required.


# Features

* Customizable number of observation symbols (M)

* Adjustable sequence length (T)

* Configurable training iterations

* Log-likelihood convergence graph

* Transition & emission heatmaps

* State probability over time plot

* Clean modern UI with responsive layout

📊 Visualizations Explained
1️⃣ Log Likelihood Convergence

Shows how the model likelihood changes across iterations.

2️⃣ Transition Matrix

Heatmap showing probabilities of moving from one state to another.

3️⃣ Emission Matrix

Heatmap showing probability of each observation given a state.

4️⃣ State Probability Over Time

Displays state-wise probabilities for each time step.
